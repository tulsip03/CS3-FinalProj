MATERIALS
This directory contains all the R scripts used in the project:
data_cleaning.R: Script for loading and preprocessing the HDI and GDI datasets, including handling missing values and formatting.
exploratory_analysis.R: Performs exploratory data analysis, generating visualizations and summary statistics to understand the data distribution and trends.
arima_modeling.R: Applies ARIMA modeling to the time series data to identify patterns and build predictive models.
forecasting.R: Uses the ARIMA models to forecast future HDI and GDI values and evaluates the model performance.

HOOK.pdf
A mission brief designed to engage students by placing them in a real-world scenario, motivating the exploration of HDI and GDI data.

RUBRIC.pdf
Outlines the evaluation criteria for the project, detailing expectations for data cleaning, visualization, analysis, and reporting.
