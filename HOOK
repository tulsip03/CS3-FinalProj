Hook Document

For this project, you are the Lead Data Analyst for a Global Development Task Force.
The year is 2025. The United Nations has enlisted you to help drive a new initiative: Equal Futures! Your mission, you ask? You have to dive deep into the world of 
international development by exploring two powerful indicators, the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Gender Development Index (GDI), to uncover global patterns, 
disparities, and other indicators to analyze the state of the world along those parameters.

As you open the dataset, you find that one thing becomes very clear: Not all development in every country is created equal. Why does a country with a high HDI still 
score low on gender equality? Are certain regions making strides toward closing gender gaps while others fall behind? What role does economic status, education, or life 
expectancy play?

In this project, you’re in the driver’s seat. Using R, you’ll wrangle, visualize, and analyze international data to tell a compelling data-driven story. Your insights 
will help the Task Force strategize future funding and development programs. Your findings could shape how development funding is allocated. They could change how 
policymakers prioritize education, healthcare, or gender rights. But first, they’ll be presented to the Equal Futures panel

Deliverable:
You’ll create a polished, insightful, and visually rich data report. The goal is to communicate clearly and compellingly to a non-technical audience what the data 
reveals and what actions should be taken in the future. (More details coming in the rubric.)
